# CDRRL
This is an anonymous github repo for the supplementary video results of "Contrastive Decoupled Representation Learning and Regularization for Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation".

We used NED and ICface models as baseline to compare the results with or without CDRRL on mead and ravdess datasets.

Each frame of the video contains 4 images, which are source, reference, results of baseline, and results of CDRRL from left to right.
